library(glue)            # for gluing strings to data

In this report we evaluate the relationship between relationship between bill depth and flipper length of penguins.
The data come from @gorman2014.
And I love this dataset.

```{r}
penguins_nongentoo <- penguins %>%
  filter(species != "Gentoo")
```

The original dataset has `r penguins$species %>% unique() %>% length()` species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap), but we will only work with Adelie and Chinstrap species.

# Exploratory data analysis

The table below shows some summary statistics.

```{r summary-stats}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_bill_depth_mm = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE) 
  ) %>%
  kable(caption = "Summary statistics")
```

# Model

The model results are in the table below.

```{r model}
m_bl_fl <- lm(bill_depth_mm ~ flipper_length_mm, data = penguins_nongentoo)
tidy_m_bl_fl <- tidy(m_bl_fl)
kable(tidy_m_bl_fl, 
      caption = "Regression output for predicting bill depth from flipper length.", 
      digits = 2)
```

The slope of the regression model is `r tidy_m_bl_fl %>% filter(term == "flipper_length_mm") %>% pull(estimate) %>% round(2)`.

# Visualize

The following figure shows the relationship between these variables, and we observe a positive slope in this visualization as well.

```{r scatterplot, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(penguins_nongentoo) +
  geom_point(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm), method = "lm") 
```

Multiple plots in the following figure.

```{r multi-plot, warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.8, out.width = "100%"}
p1 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()

p2 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()

p3 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)

(p1 + p2) / p3 +
  plot_annotation(
    tag_levels = "A",
    title = "The surprising truth about penguins",
    subtitle = "These 3 plots will reveal yet-untold secrets about our beloved data-set",
    caption = "Disclaimer: None of these plots are insightful"
    ) + 
  plot_layout(guides = "collect") & theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
